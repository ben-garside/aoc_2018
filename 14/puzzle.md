# Day 14 

When submitting your answers do so with a file with your name (or github id if you rather) in to the correct folder, as there are two puzzles per day you may either combine them in to one file, with a :

`[myName].[ext]` -> `benjamin.py`

Or split them out in to two:

`[myName]-1.[ext]` -> `benjamin-1.py`  
`[myName]-2.[ext]` -> `benjamin-2.py`

Do not upload your input, or your actual answer and why not comment your code to help your team learn :)
