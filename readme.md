## What is this

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

### Tips

If you get stuck, try your solution against the examples given in the puzzle; you should get the same answers. If not, re-read the description. Did you misunderstand something? Is your program doing something you don't expect? After the examples work, if your answer still isn't correct, build some test cases for which you can verify the answer by hand and see if those work with your program. If you're still stuck, maybe ask a friend for help, or come back to the puzzle later. You can also ask for hints in the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/).

## Instructions for this repo

There is a folder for each day

* 01
* 02
* ...

When submitting your answers do so with a file with your name (or github id if you rather) in to the correct folder, as there are two puzzles per day you may either combine them in to one file, with a :

`[myName].[ext]` -> `benjamin.py`

Or split them out in to two:

`[myName]-1.[ext]` -> `benjamin-1.py`  
`[myName]-2.[ext]` -> `benjamin-2.py`

Do not upload your input, or your actual answer and why not comment your code to help your team learn :)
